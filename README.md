# Article Templates for Mobile Apps
Article templates used within the Guardianâ€™s next-generation iOS and Android applications. This repo also contains documentation that describes the components and layouts used across these templates.

## Requirements
* A Mac or Linux PC
* Ruby >= v1.9.x. You may already have this, but run `ruby -v` to check which version you have installed.
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io). Install using `gem install bundler`.

## Usage
Assuming you have checked out this project, open a console and change directory into the root of the project.

This project has two parts; the templates used by the applications (`/ArticleTemplates/`), and the documentation (built locally to `/Documentation/` from the files located in `/DocumentationTemplates/`).

To get started, run:

`bundle install`

to install Ruby dependancies. Then run:

`bundle exec guard`

This will start [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), which we use to run the following build tasks:

* Compile SCSS files for article templates
* Compile SCSS files for documentation
* Lint these SCSS files to ensure consistent code style. Linter rules are configured with [.scss-lint.yml](ArticleTemplates/assets/scss/.scss-lint.yml)
* Build documentation files. Documentation is built using [Hologram](https://github.com/trulia/hologram), and is configured with [hologram.yml](hologram.yml)

## Updating the Documentation
Documentation is built locally, but also available on the web at: http://guardian.github.io/mobile-apps-article-templates/, which displays the static files stored in the gh-pages branch. To update this publically viewable site with your latest changes, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git commit -am "Commit message"
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ git merge master
$ git push origin master gh-pages
```

Alternatively, you can set up your local git repository to automatically push changes to both master and gh-pages branches. Simply add the following 2 lines to the ``[remote "origin"]`` section of ``.git/config``:

```
push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/gh-pages
push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master
```
