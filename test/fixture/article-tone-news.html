                    <p>I worked in the advertising world for 30 years. It’s an industry that profits from mindless consuming but, if they don’t change their tune and their business model, the industry will perish. Consumers are getting smarter, and the “tricks” used to influence us are becoming increasingly obvious. If I want to buy something, I turn to comments and user reviews now. I have stopped all impulse buying since I eliminated advertising from my diet. My life is simple, peaceful, and there’s less of a sense of “I need more, more, more!”</p>
                    <p>I don’t agree with John Whittingdale’s saying that adblocking is a ‘modern-day protection racket.’ I think content sharing is the new way in a new world. We need to find another way to appreciate content, and we need to find it soon. We need to think more like artists, who will produce regardless of whether or not they are paid. Passionate people are happy people, and a society can be productive and happy without profitability. How about just fair wages and no competition? Then everyone wins. Capitalism is woefully unsustainable, as greed has become pandemic.</p>

                <h2><strong><em>‘Ads should be designed around the user’ - Courtney Allen (28), digital communications, London</em></strong></h2>
                <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>Online advertising is often done in a way that is obtrusive to the experience you expect when you go to a site. Some sites force you to view a full screen video, when you came to read a text article. In addition some of these ads cost you more money in data than you would have expected from viewing a page of text and images. They are designed in a way to make you look at them. The overt ones, in some cases, make you lose interest in reading what you intended to because it is not worth the hassle of being forced to sit through the ads. I don’t agree with the whitelisting process being implemented. I think all ads should have an opportunity to appear on the web if they follow a set of standards that ensure they aren’t aggressively obtrusive. They should not have to pay for that.</p>
                    <p>I favour subscription models for ad free access to content. Adverts should be unique to the design of a website and work for the needs of a user. Breaking up long pieces of text can be good for the user, there just needs to be a line.</p>
                    <p>Whittingdale’s statement is an extreme one with a clear purpose. There might be a reduction of content, or possibly even lower quality content, but there’s no chance we’ll see the world going back to printed media to recover cost. All ads aren’t bad but the aggressive ones force users to resort to blocking them. If the ads are designed around the user and not dictated by the goals of big brands, there is no reason why they can’t have a permanent place online.</p>

                    <p>I can accept the annoyance of online advertising, and even the detrimental effect it has on page loading times, because I understand that businesses have bills to pay and that advertising helps cover some of those costs. What I can’t accept is being stalked across the web by various ad-selling agencies using beacons and cookies, which in any other industry would be called ‘spyware’ or ‘malware,’ to track my every movement online. Modern online advertising is more about building individual profiles than it is about selling ads - and that’s wrong.</p>
                    <p>But I completely agree with Whittingdale. The public need to understand that for every free item a company gives away, someone somewhere is being robbed to pay for it. In the case of newspapers, that person is a journalist. We’re all rapidly becoming enslaved to ‘free,’ enriching shareholders in mega brands, but cutting the value and earnings of everyone else in the process. In effect, ‘free’ is simply speeding up the transfer of wealth to the super-rich.</p>

                    <p>Advertising providers have caused this situation for themselves by allowing their ads to contain phishing links, malware, pornographic images, irritations such as flashing colours and sound, stealing data and draining data allowances. I use an adblocker because I don’t trust advertising providers to offer safe content on websites I visit. Companies should be blaming advertising networks for the reputation they have given themselves instead of blaming the end users who are just trying to stay safe.</p>
                    <p>I agree with Whittingdale’s statement, however I don’t believe advertisements are always the way people should pay. Services like Netflix for example seem to have the right idea. Companies need to start vetting those who want to advertise and start respecting the customer in the process. I don’t like feeling tricked or deceived into buying a product by celebrity endorsements.</p>

                <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>A family member died in tragic circumstances a few months ago. Adware clearly picked this up from my emails and, ever since, when I occasionally use a non-adblocked browser, the web is still trying to flog me black clothes and funeral plans, often in the creepiest language. It’s futile for the advertisers and invasive for me. I see them in a small time way as the enemy, and take pleasure in outwitting their attempts to shower my online environment. I always lie on demographic forms if they are forced on me. I told Facebook I’m 106, and now get ads only for bingo and late life love, which amuse me very much.</p>
                    <p>I also dislike the whole manipulative language of advertising. I’d feel less low grade resentment towards something more straightforward. Whittingdale is correct, but if services want me to turn the adblocker off, they need to switch back to non-flashing non-filmic ads down the edges, rather than increasingly aggressive ones which seem almost designed to make users cross. I wonder if the evolution of micropayments might offer a solution. I wouldn’t mind that.</p>

                    <p>I find targeted advertising to be stereotyping, sexist and intrusive. I understand that websites I enjoy and truly appreciate rely on this revenue, but I see this as an in-between time; as more and more people continue to use adblocking software, websites will have to switch to user-pay systems and rely on subscriptions for revenue. I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing. I’m happy to pay for news, and do already pay for some. I imagine it’ll be a return to a more traditional system in a new format.</p>

                <h2><em><strong>‘The consumer needs to have control over the type of adverts they are exposed to while browsing’ Louise (23), Horsham, UK </strong></em></h2>
                <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>As a person with autism I am extremely sensitive to adverts which contain loud sounds and flashing images. Often these kinds of adverts will pop up when I’m halfway through watching a video on Youtube and they will actually trigger an autistic meltdown. During a meltdown I lose all control of higher cognitive functions, such as speech and the ability to reason and think rationally, and I become violent towards myself. It’s a very frightening experience.</p>
                    <p>Another reason why I block adverts is that you can’t control the type of adverts that you will see on the internet. Recently on youtube there were adverts for horror movies, which I detest due to their disturbing content, and adverts for awareness on sexual abuse in schools. While I know the latter issue is very serious and needs more public awareness, the advert is very shocking and I know a few people who have been emotionally triggered by it, due to their similar past experiences in schools. Needless to say, it was very distressing for them to relive those memories, when all they were trying to do was watch a video on youtube.</p>
                    <p>I believe that if there are to be adverts on the internet, the consumer needs to have control over the type of adverts they are exposed to while browsing. If I had the ability to control the adverts I was personally exposed to, they would have to be autism friendly; no loud noises, no flashing images, no bright colours, no rapid speech and no disturbing content. They would also have to present themselves before the video I wanted to view started playing as adverts which pop up mid-activity disrupt my routine and can also trigger a meltdown simply with their poor timing. Companies need to be aware of people on the autistic spectrum when it comes to online advertising. We have very specific needs which must be catered for to ensure a good quality of life. Opt-out systems need to be introduced; consumers need to be allowed to control which adverts they are exposed to.</p>
                    <p>While money does make the world go round, this issue is never as clear cut as Whittingdale presents it. Wikipedia is a prime example of this. The website survives on non-compulsory donations from users, without the need for adverts cluttering its articles. As someone who uses Wikipedia on a daily basis, I really appreciate the fact the website has retained its academic environment, allowing me to freely use their content without being disrupted by adverts. I donate to Wikipedia regularly to ensure this type of practice remains viable.</p>

                    <p>In my professions I have to scan hundreds of search engine result pages, and I use adblockers to cut down on PPC results to reduce the paid media clutter on the results. But I don’t necessarily support adblocking, primarily because it’s unfair to content creators. A lot of media organisations spend a lot of money and effort to put out content that interests people, admittedly page views, ad impressions and clicks are motivations. Without those motivations will good content exist? Maybe. But I don’t think it would in it’s current high volume.</p>
                    <p>The only other way publishers can make money is subscriptions, which doesn’t work well for many types of content. Apart from that advertorials and partnered paid for content could be a good revenue stream, however I think in many organisations this would lead to bias towards advertisers.</p>
                    <p>I disagree with Whittingdale. Content has many purposes, for example YouTube videos will still grow as people use that medium to market their own services. So people willing to get something out of publishing good content, beyond simply ad views will always put out good content.</p>

                <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>I do not use adblocking but I can see why people want to. It is becoming as horrible as some print newspapers, where advertising takes up more space on pages than actual stories. There has to be a way to manage it better. I can understand those who prefer not to have certain ads show up, be it personal preference, children, or other reasons. Blocking everything just isn’t realistic, however, webmasters have to be reigned in or risk losing traffic. As a business owner I’d fire my webmaster if ads were clogging our site. Ads need to be clean, simple and creative - not overwhelming and tiresome.</p>
                    <p>I’m all for advertising but webmasters and companies have to understand not everyone has the latest fastest greatest PC, or the fastest upload capability. By simply altering this perception, web pages can be better designed, built and managed. How much traffic do they lose because a potential customer does not have the latest PC or the fastest upload capability? I’m a fan of online newspapers, however, I’ve seen a number of them, especially in the US, succumb to atrocious web management practices. Forget adblocking software - people simply do not return.</p>
                    <p>Advertisers get paid to be creative, to fit a niche, to stand out from the crowd. The bigger and louder approach is not king, neither is using video for each and every advertisement. Smaller banners and a creative use of space could be more productive practices. It hurts the small business owner to succumb to the larger corporations who want to run and own the digital highway.</p>

                    <p>I dislike targeted ads that are the result of search history data scraping. Not everything users search for online is of lasting interest to the user. It also feels creepy to constantly be confronted by the fact that your search data has been scraped, when you visit a page and see a targeted ad. There need to be more granular options for paying for content (for example, short term passes). Websites also need to allow users to turn off targeted ads, but perhaps have those users agree to general, non-targeted ads.</p>
                    <p>I agree with Whittingdale’s statement. Nothing is free and it’s unrealistic to think that businesses can continue to operate without being paid at some point along the chain. In addition professional journalists, editors, and photographers need time and money to develop meaningful content. At the same time businesses should not take the easiest or laziest route to increasing ad revenue and, in doing so, assume that users will remain complacent about what’s served to them.</p>

                <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>I had no issue with online advertising until about five years ago, when a number of my favourite websites for reading online articles introduced “site takeovers.” This means that the entire website is framed by an enormous product advert, which is often animated and always extremely distracting. This was in addition to normal banner advertising and pop-ups so the strain on page load times was ridiculous. I would often accidentally click on these adverts while trying to navigate websites.</p>
                    <p>Essentially my patience has been exhausted by these companies. They have no respect for their readers, so I see no reason to respect their right to finance their content. We hear a lot about the plight of publishers who describe themselves as being “respectful” or “one of the good guys,” but I’ve yet to find one whose adverts are genuinely unintrusive. I have a lot of sympathy for publishers losing revenue, I really do, but I’ve yet to hear a case convincing enough that I’m willing to give up my adblocker. My viewpoint is that the onus should be on the publishers to find a way around this problem, which they themselves created, not on the consumer to stop using the software.</p>
                    <p>I’m not a fan of advertorial content but I suspect this will be the future of online publishing. The only way to circumvent the ad blockers will be to make the advertising part of the editorial. Many people highlight the ethical problems with this type of content, but it’s really no different to the paid promotional features that many magazines already run in their print issues.</p>

                    <p>I have chronic vertigo. Flashing, spinning or other sudden movements can set off a serious vertigo attack. I use an adblocker to make the internet accessible. Without an ad blocker as part of my toolset, the internet is simply not accessible to me. I have to constantly prepare for becoming suddenly and seriously ill.</p>
                    <p>Ways to improve the user experience are subscriptions and guaranteed small text-only (or text-and-still-picture only) ads that don’t contain scripts, animation or sounds. Publishers should also stop relying on outside advertising providers that often supply inappropriate content, like pornographic ads on a business site.</p>
                    <p>I agree with Whittingdale to an extent, but it’s also true that a lot of content, both online and off, doesn’t need to exist and he’s clinging to obsolete media models.</p>
