                    <p>The chair of a Labour inquiry into antisemitism has said she will not seek evidence from the former London mayor Ken Livingstone, whose suspension from the party led to a crisis that resulted in the inquest being set up.</p>
                    <p>Shami Chakrabarti disclosed that she had joined the Labour party on 29 April, the <a draggable="true" href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims">day she was asked to head up the investigation</a>, which could raise questions about her independence. </p>
                    <p>She told reporters that it would be unfair to “positively solicit” a submission from Livingstone because <a draggable="true" href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks">he is facing a separate investigation</a> that could result in his expulsion from the party.<br tabindex="-1"></p>
                    <p>Stating that the inquiry would report within two months, the <a draggable="true" href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2016/jan/14/shami-chakrabarti-steps-down-liberty-director-12-years">former director of the human rights group Liberty</a> said she would ask the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to appear. </p>
                    <p>It comes as Corbyn prepares to meet with MPs on the all-party group for antisemitism next week, who will set out their proposals as to how the inquiry can be truly independent.</p>
                    <p>Chakrabarti, speaking about her decision to join Labour, said: “I wanted Labour party members and supporters to trust that, while I am independent of any person or group or wing of the party, I am conducting this inquiry with their best interest and values at heart.</p>
                    <p>“It was my judgment and on the day I accepted the brief.” <br></p>
                    <p>Chakrabarti was flanked by her two deputy chairs, Jan Royall, whose own <a draggable="true" href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2016/feb/17/labour-condemns-antisemitism-oxford-university-labour-club-claims">investigation into antisemitism at Oxford University’s Labour club</a> will be published on Tuesday, and Prof David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism.</p>
                    <p>She was forced to defend Feldman after it emerged that he was a signatory to Independent Jewish Voices (IJV), a group that has described some of the claims of antisemitism within Labour as “baseless and disingenuous”.</p>
                    <p>Chakrabarti said she had total confidence in Feldman, who had backed an earlier statement from IJV on global human rights but, she said, distanced himself from the more recent intervention. </p>
                    <p>Despite the controversy, the Labour MP John Mann, <a draggable="true" href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2016/apr/28/john-mann-calls-ken-livingstone-a-nazi-apologist-video">who confronted Livingstone on live television</a> alleging that he was a “Nazi apologist”, said Chakrabarti had to be given the benefit of the doubt and that the terms of reference were key.</p>
                    <p>“Members of our all-party group [on antisemitism] will be meeting with Jeremy Corbyn next week to set out our expectations of the operational independence of the inquiry,” he said.</p>
