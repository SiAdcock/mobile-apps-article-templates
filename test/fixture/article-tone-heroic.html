                    <p> For Liverpool law student Jennifer Mitchell, inspiration struck when she was out with her boyfriend. Jennifer was one of the hundreds of readers who have responded over the last week with suggestions for this new project exploring Labour and Liverpool: you have shared your thoughts on issues to examine, places to visit and people to contact.<br></p>
                    <p>What prompted Jennifer to respond? “Do you want the honest answer? I was having some tapas and a large bottle of wine as I was flicking through Facebook and I said: ‘Who should I nominate?’”</p>

                    <p>After tossing about some names, her boyfriend suggested her father. “And I said ‘Oh God, yes.’ Sometimes it is so close to home … When it comes to politics in Liverpool he is really proud of what he does.”</p>
                    <p>This was one of many, many good suggestions. What was heartening was not just the number of you who responded, but also the seriousness of the replies. Issues raised include: can Jeremy Corbyn win a general election?; interview mayor Joe Anderson; will the boundary changes proposed for 2018 effectively amount to deselection; members who joined as a result of Jeremy Corbyn last year are upset at being excluded from nominating the Labour candidate for mayor; and what happened to all those members of Militant from the 1980s? <br></p>
                    <p>Districts to visit were suggested, with specific routes and locations. Someone suggested speaking to a newsagent in Lark Lane, others a supermarket in Lodge Lane that reflects the multi-ethnic nature of Toxteth.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting services</h2>
                    <p>On Tuesday, I began following up on those suggestions. Jennifer’s proposal – that I talk to her father, Peter Mitchell, 58 – turned out to be good first stop. Peter is from Croxteth, which gained notoriety in 2007 when schoolboy Rhys Jones was shot dead in a gang attack. He is a Hillsborough survivor – the experience has had a huge impact on his life, leading him eventually to switch from working in the private sector to the public. The campaign for justice had demonstrated the sense of solidarity of Liverpool when under attack, he explained.</p>

                    <p> Peter is one of 80 Labour councillors on the 90-seat Liverpool city council, where he is the mayoral lead on parks and open spaces. He is also one of the 12 councillors who supported Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign. “After the debacle over the welfare bill Jeremy was the only was who was voicing the opinion of the vast majority of the members,” he said. “I think it was a sea change moment in the campaign.”</p>
                    <p> We sat in the mayoral boardroom overlooking the Mersey. Much of our conversation was devoted to the impact of council spending cuts, which Peter put at 58% in real terms over the past six years. “Liverpool had received the biggest cut of any core city in the country,” he said. “Fact.”</p>
                    <p>He has embraced a new model for Liverpool, running food banks, helping creating jobs and handing over facilities such as libraries and sports centres for others to run. “What we’ve done is delivered a series of innovative solutions to enable us to deliver services for our community … Local authorities will absolutely have to become commissioners rather than deliverers of services. Have to. Because the money doesn’t stack up.” <em><br></em></p>
                    <p> The model has seen him questioned by other socialists, who say he should be fighting Tory cuts on the streets as Militant did in the 1980s. “Nonsense,” he said, adding: “What I have done is protected my services.” <br></p>

                    <p>But even Peter can see problems ahead. “On 1 April 2017 … we fall off a cliff,” he said. “I’m going stand on the edge of that cliff and make somebody push me off because I’m going to defend my community in the best way I can.”</p>
                    <p>It is an issue worth exploring further.</p>
                    <p>There are a lot of dead ends when researching stories, but that is part of the job. On Tuesday I also took a trip to the Toxteth supermarket, which did not throw up any ideas. The next venue was not particularly fruitful either: the newsagent in Lark Lane was away for the afternoon. I spoke to a barber nearby and his customers but the issue that exercised them was the impact a new Co-operative store is having on Lark Lane independent shops.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the day calls and emails came in from readers who said they would be available for interviews. I ran out of time – when I next visit, for a longer period, I look forward to coming back to these offers. <br></p>
                    <p>So what have I learned and what do I need to do next? I have only made two quick trips so far but I have found people in Liverpool, like those in my native Glasgow and in Belfast, where I spent time early in my journalistic career, are approachable and ready to express a view about politics. <br></p>
                    <h2>Building contacts<br></h2>
                    <p>I do not have a feel for the city or its politics yet but I am building up a good network of contacts for Labour at grassroots level. One of the issues frequently raised by respondents to the questionnaire is how constituency Labour parties (CLPs) are handling the influx of new members that flowed in as part of the Corbyn campaign. In future weeks I will introduce you to Sarah Byrne, who switched from the Greens to Labour when Corbyn became leader last year, and has struggled with the monthly meetings of her CLP.</p>
                    <p>But I also need to contact official Labour: the MPs, the north-west regional organiser, the press officers, and the the chairs and secretaries of the CLPs. I need to reach out to more councillors, to members of Momentum and Labour organisers in the universities as well as academics and people from the city’s lively cultural life. <br></p>
                    <p>Having spent time with Peter Mitchell, I finished Tuesday by meeting Jennifer at the Rococo independent coffee house in the city centre.</p>
                    <p>Jennifer, 23, has been in the Labour party since she was a teenager and celebrated when Corbyn won, but she is sceptical as to whether he can widen his appeal beyond the Labour party; she had been contemplating supporting Chuka Umunna. She discusses politics with friends through Whatsapp these days rather than attending CLP meetings.</p>
                    <p> I am grateful to Jennifer for suggesting I meet her dad. But also for suggesting meeting at the Rococo. I can get through most days after a decent cup of coffee in the morning.<br></p>
                    <p>I am going to enjoy this project. It is rare for a journalist to be given time to explore an issue and city in detail. The project is off to a good start: this flying visit turned up lots of ideas and potential contacts – not to mention what could turn out to be a regular coffee spot.</p>
