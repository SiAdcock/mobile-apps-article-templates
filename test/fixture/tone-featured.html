                    Stanford University students lolled around the school’s quadrangle last week, enjoying an unusually warm and sunny February in the shadow of Silicon Valley, where so many of them have high career aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were no marches or protests. There was no shrine in the field next to the Kappa Alpha fraternity – even though Brock Turner, a 19-year-old freshman and varsity swimmer, allegedly raped a “completely unresponsive” 18-year-old woman he had met there; even though police found her passed out behind a dumpster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last week, Turner pleaded not guilty to five felony counts, including rape of an unconscious person and rape of an intoxicated person. And perhaps the most elite university in the United States went about business as usual – at least on the outside – less than a month after the kind of alleged incident that has turned campus sexual assault into what activists call a nationwide epidemic and that President Barack Obama called
                    <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/22/remarks-president-and-vice-president-event-council-women-and-girls">“totally unacceptable”</a>
                    because “it can still go on in the shadows”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stanford students said they were shocked by details in
                    <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1532973-complaint-brock-turner.html">the 53-page police report</a>
                    into the alleged sexual assault, and unsurprised that the case of a clean-cut star athlete and a frat party gone horribly wrong had garnered international media attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He embodied the all-American boy next door,” said Taylor Brown, a pre-med student who
                    <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/01/28/rape-an-uncomfortable-truth/">wrote a column in the student newspaper</a>
                    insisting that rapists were not always “monsters” so much as “normal people” on campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s the first time a case like this has been so public with the full, nasty details,” she told the Guardian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the Stanford incident is in many ways the best of a worst-case scenario: students ascribed the relatively muted reactions on the quad to the weirdly reassuring reality that two graduate students say they intervened to chase down Turner, that he was kicked off the swim team and withdrew from the university, and – in stark contrast to so many cases made public when alleged assailants go lightly punished, if at all – that university authorities acted swiftly and decisively to a police investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This restores some faith in the administration,” said Luka Sipaia Fatuesi, a 20-year-old student at a school where 25 forcible sex offenses were
                    <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/SUDPS/safety-report/Almanac.pdf">reported</a>
                    to campus authorities in 2013, though that number is almost certainly higher –
                    <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/sexual_assault_report_1-21-14.pdf">Obama’s White House task force</a>
                    found a year ago that just 12% of all such attacks are reported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “One of the biggest impediments that victims often face when deciding to report is fear of how the community is going to react,” said Scott Berkowitz, founder and president of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. He said it was “unusual” for discussion of such a high-profile case as that of the Stanford swimmer to have become so eerily quiet compared to other US college campuses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, a more thorough look at how Stanford students reacted in private to what by police accounts was a public assault – indeed, how students found out about it at all – reveals how even the best official response to a sexual assault case can leave an academic community paralyzed the next time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is becoming increasingly the norm for students to talk about campus rape not with their friends and educators in a vocal academic setting but in a new kind of shadow world of anonymous social media apps, such as Yik Yak. The conversations are by turns nasty, confined and in no small part a safeguard against a digital trail that might stop a Stanford graduate from inventing his own version of Snapchat some day.

                <p>
                    For days, the only public mention of the 18 January incident involving Turner was
                    <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/01/21/police-blotter-jan-13-jan-19/">
                        one sentence in the Stanford Daily’s Monday morning police roundup
                    </a>
                    . Students said there was not much outward chatter about the incident, even at fraternity gatherings over the course of the week. But the line caught the interest of the Fountain Hopper, an email newsletter with a crusading, whistleblower bent that claims to reach 80% of Stanford’s 7,000 undergraduates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The way it was in the paper blotter was very different than what we usually see,” said a Fountain Hopper contributor who, in the spirit of the newsletter and like many of the Stanford students interviewed for this article, asked to remain anonymous. “There was one suspect. There were five witnesses.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next five days, the Fountain Hopper called prosecutors, police and administrators to deliver the news that Turner, a prized swimming recruit, had been arrested on five counts and released on $150,000 bail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “When we pushed the email, reaction was kind of instant,” said the contributor. “We got dozens of emails expressing amazement … that this was happening.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Television crews arrived the next morning, and ensuing reports painted a fuller picture of the incident:
                    <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/01/27/freshman-male-athlete-arrested-for-attempted-rape-on-jan-18/">the alleged victim</a>
                    was not a Stanford student and Turner had voluntarily left the school, after two passing cyclists say they

                    on top of “a woman attending an on-campus party” before he ran and they chased him down. (Turner

                    he was kissing the woman on the ground, “never got her name”, did not have intercourse and that “his ‘intentions were not to try and rape a girl without her consent’”. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian about conflicts in the police report that Turner
                    <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1532973-complaint-brock-turner.html">“was suddenly tackled by a group of guys”</a>
                    .)
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Stanford, as with other colleges and universities across the US, sexual assault investigations are kept hush-hush by design. The secretive adjudication process is mandated by federal law and usually undertaken by members of the campus community rather
                    <a href="https://provost.stanford.edu/frequently-asked-questions-regarding-handling-sexual-assault-cases-stanford">than trained law enforcement</a>
                    . Names of alleged perpetrators and victims are kept secret, as are details about cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Clery Act forces schools to declare campus crime data, at risk of losing federal funding. But
                    <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/law-0000037.pdf">new research from the University of Kansas</a>
                    shows that official reports of sexual assault tend to go up during a Clery audit and while under close inspection – then dip back down. Often, as with the Columbia University student who
                    <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/-sp-campus-rape-prevention-yes-means-yes">carried the bed upon which she says she was raped</a>
                    around campus as an art project, it takes an aggrieved victim to speak out for a case to go public at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when an anonymous email newsletter began asking questions, and the Santa Clara countysheriff’s office handed out a detailed police report, Stanford had on its hands not just a scandal but perhaps the most transparent real-time example of what the White House report had called “a particular problem” and over which the Obama administration said it would “hold schools accountable if they do not confront sexual violence on their campuses”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what if the students refused to confront it out loud in the first place?

                    Late last school year, Stanford students rallied around another viral

                    to hold her alleged rapist accountable through the school’s disciplinary process and demanding a call to action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students protested, filled a wall on campus with messages of support and posted photos on Instagram and Twitter under the hashtag
                    <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-student-email-sexual-assault-campus-protest-2014-6">#StandWithLeah</a>
                    .

                <p>
                    So when the Turner case began to explode out in the open, some students expected a similar reaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Everyone knew sexual assaults were happening but there was no proof,” said Brown, who wrote the column in the student paper. “Everyone’s bubble has been a little burst by this case.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    That bubble exists primarily inside the world of Yik Yak, an increasingly popular – and controversial – social-sharing platform that allows its users to post anonymously. The app groups communities together using geolocation – the kind of instant community message board has made it a hit at schools since its launch

                    Anonymous thoughts on Yik Yak can range from benign observations about campus life to more indignant fodder;

                    posts at the University of North Carolina and elsewhere have led schools to review allowing the app at all.

                    “It’s absolutely our campus zeitgeist at any one moment,” Andrew Aude, a 21-year-old computer science major, said of the app. “Usually, it’s like, ‘I have so much homework’ or ‘I partied too hard last night’, but if there’s one large event they’re all going to go to Yik Yak and talk about it.”

                    After Turner’s arrest started making the rounds on the Fountain Hopper email, students didn’t take to the quad to talk about rape in public – they took their shock to their iPhones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You can overlook the scary fear factor of it when you don’t know what happened, but this is concrete,” said Ariella Axler, a Stanford senior and intern at the White House office of
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?company=The+White+House+Office+of+Science+and+Technology+Policy&amp;trk=prof-exp-company-name">science and technology policy</a>

                    While the messages have vanished from the record, students described the Yik Yak conversations about the alleged rape after the Kappa Alpha party as a mix of collective horror, tasteless victim-blaming and outright misogyny – “Where all the unconscious bishes at?” read one. The posts contained little big-picture dialogue about prevention, awareness or even the two bicyclists who say they caught Turner before he could escape. Administrators and parents are nowhere to be seen or heard in the secretive campus debate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even when Stanford students did turn to public platforms such as Twitter, they were talking about the anonymous debate happening elsewhere.

                    “Another
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Stanford?src=hash">#Stanford</a>
                    student wrote on Yik Yak that it was ‘sexist’ to charge the perpetrator, as both parties were drunk,”
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/sashaperigo/status/560521269443956736">tweeted</a>
                    computer science major Sasha Perigo.

                <p>
                    Gabriella Isabelle Johnson, an African American studies major, said she was “desensitized” by the volume of rape allegations on Stanford’s campus and called Yik Yak a “problematic and offensive” venue for discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s a horrible application that was created because people can post things anonymously, and it’s a site for bullying,” Johnson said. “They just want to post and create this destruction and unsafe space in the mobile app world.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yik Yak’s community manager, Ben Popkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, though he recently wrote
                    <a href="http://blog.yikyakapp.com/bullying-isnt-cool/">a blogpost</a>
                    about the app’s bullying filters. But conversations on the app, like its users, appear far from two-dimensional. Comments can be both offensive and incisive, and in some cases serve as a forum for debate.

                    “Guys stop raping,” posted one user whose geolocation late last month showed Stanford University. Another user responded: “I’m a guy and a girl sexually assault me. Girls do bad things too. Don’t just blame one gender. #equality.”

                    Yik Yaks may disappear in a matter of hours, but Stanford students – especially the ones who would like to hang around Silicon Valley when they graduate – know that expressing an opinion in college can last forever on the internet.

                    After all, the king of vanishing message apps is 24-year-old Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegler, whose emails from his own fraternity days at Stanford leaked last year, with plenty of references to parties, intoxicated young women and

                    . Spiegel has said he was

                    , and current Stanford undergrads cited career opportunities as a reason to use anonymous platforms – and little else – when discussing controversial campus issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “People are self-censoring because they’re afraid of future scrutiny,” said one student who declined to be named.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That’s the new reality here,” said another student, who works on the Fountain Hopper email. “People do not want to ascribe their names to opinions – ever – because people are incredibly concerned with what happens to those opinions in 20 or 30 years.”

                    The Hopper’s exposé on Turner’s arrest arrived just days before a Stanford graduate sued another prominent Stanford alumnus, Joe Lonsdale, a founder of the secretive software firm Palantir. Lonsdale is

                    , a claim he has vigorously disputed with

                    and
                    <a href="http://joelonsdalestatement.com/">a website</a>
                    describing “a vengeful, personal attack by a disturbed former girlfriend”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Allegations have come out recently about several executives in Silicon Valley,” said a female computer science major who asked not to be named. “I’m worried that a Google search associating my name with sexual assault policy reform could hurt my professional career.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Activists said they understood if students felt uncomfortable talking in public about sexual assault – “this is not a problem that is specific to Stanford”, said Berkowitz – but they insisted that the urge for anonymity could be used for better data and even wholesale reform.

                    A bill that has been languishing in Congress since August, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, would actually encourage anonymous surveys, providing federal funding to ask every student on a campus about sexual violence at their school and sharing the findings with parents and prospective students. The legislation’s language also allows for schools to “request additional information from students that would increase the institutions’ understanding of school climate factors unique to their campuses”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several senators
                    <a href="http://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/gillibrand-mccaskill-lead-bipartisan-letter-for-new-resources-to-fight-sexual-assaults-on-college-campuses">sent a letter</a>
                    that also requested funding to investigate “the 63% of schools that failed to report crime statistics in the manner required by the Clery Act”. They cited the several dozen colleges and universities under sexual-violence investigation by the federal Department of Education for violations of federal education amendments made in 1972, known as Title IX. (
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=71+schools+rape">Stanford was not among the schools listed last year</a>
                    .) Such violations can imperil universities’ federal student-aid eligibility, one of the largest single sources of tuition money.

                <p>
                    When he announced the rollout of his campus assault campaign in September, Obama admitted that intervening is “not always easy to do with all the social pressures to stay quiet or go along”. Stanford was
                    <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/college_list_updated_final_0.pdf">listed as one of several schools</a>
                    with student leaders committed to the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The more we can bring attention to this,” Berkowitz said of campus assaults, be they reported, unreported or Yik-Yak’d, “the more we can help survivors understand that they’re far from alone.”
