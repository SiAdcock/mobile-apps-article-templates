		<h2>Preamble</h2>
		 
  <p>Team USA’s upcoming encounter against Canada is not only the marquee matchup of a day of men’s Olympic ice hockey semifinals, but arguably, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/sochi/2014/02/20/usa-canada-rivalry-men-hockey/5641253/">it’s the game of the tournament</a> - there’s no need for any of us to pretend that it’s not. However, we’d all be making a big mistake by minimizing Sweden and Finland’s hockey credentials, and their very own Scandinavian rivalry, which is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/sochi/2014/02/20/sweden-finland-semifinal-advance-men-hockey/5644093/">one of the strongest in the game.</a> Fact is, on Sunday, either one of these teams are capable of walking out of Sochi’s Bolshoy Ice Dome wearing gold around their necks - Sweden <a href="http://www.hhof.com/graphspot/one_Sweden06OG_03.jpg">have won it the tournament twice</a> in their previous six Olympic tournaments, while Finland have medaled in four of the last five Games, with three of those medals coming <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/20/finland-sweden-alternating-swipes-ahead-of-semifinal">since NHLers joined the fray, the most of any nation</a>. So yes, there is some serious hockey about to come our way, but since we can’t resist putting every little thing in life into a nice tidy little box, let’s just agree just call this game a 1b on today’s doubleheader and move on. </p>
  <p>Deal?</p>
  <p>OK.</p>
  <p>When you consider that Finland was once actually part of Sweden, for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden%E2%80%93Finland">very, very, very long time,</a> you begin to understand just why there’s more to this rivalry other than just two countries that happen to share a border and play the same game. Still, the steady Scandinavian mind set prevents matters from getting completely out of control, with players such as Sweden’s Daniel Alfredsson keeping it cool.</p>
  <p>I think it was a more intense rivalry in the past than it is now. I think now it’s a healthy, friendly rivalry, whereas they used to look up to us as big brother, but they’ve had some great success...they’ve had tremendous success here in the Olympics, we’ve met them pretty much every time, and I don’t think it’s so much big brother/little brother any more.</p>
  <p>Maybe yes, maybe no. When Sweden’s head coach Par Marts was asked who would win the quarterfinal game between Finland and Russia, Marts did something we’re not used to seeing. He answered the question, honestly. “Russia” he replied, providing a little pre-game lockerroom fodder for the Finns.</p>
  <p>That’s a snapshot of some of the mental aspects heading into this particular game, but what about on the ice? Well, the rumor around Sochi is that <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2014/icehockey/story/_/id/10488118/2014-sochi-olympics-watch-finland-sweden-face-off">Sweden have yet to play their best game of the tournament,</a> which means if they did happen to put it all together, Finland would quickly find themselves on their back skate. Captain Niklas Kronwall, goalie <a href="http://www.hlundqvist30.com/">Henrik Lundqvist</a>, who anchored the 2006 gold medal team that defeated Finland in the final, and Erik Karlsson are part of a talented group generally seen to be more gifted than the Finns. Then again, almost everybody is seen to be more skillful that the Finns, and yet, Suomi are always in the mix. This time around, they’ve done it despite major injuries that have put players such as 43-year-old <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=705726">Teemu Selanne</a> back into the forefront - the future Hall-of-Famer has responded by putting up four points for his club. <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/02/19/russia-eliminated-tuukka-rask-finland/v5XbOhJLikNyc0vCUji0cP/story.html">Tuukka Rask</a> has been phenomenal in net for his country and he and Lundqvist have probably been the best two goalies in the tournament not named <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000642768653/0647f701b3135b928e7056f541c0b45b.jpeg">Florence Schelling.</a></p>
  <p>That means this game could very well be a tight, low scoring affair, but we’ll find out if that theory holds any frozen water soon enough - the puck will drop at 700AM EST and noon in the UK. Use this time well - tweet it out, whatever it is, to <a href="https://twitter.com/LengelDavid">@lengeldavid</a> or, just use email, there’s certainly no shame in that - <a href="mailto:david.lengel.freelance@theguardian.com">david.lengel.freelance@theguardian.com</a>.</p>
  <p>Standby for Olympic semifinal hockey from Sochi. </p>

  <p>...the stakes were even higher, with Sweden and Finland playing for gold in Turin. The Three Crowns won 3-2, in dramatic fashion. Please watch this video, which has some of the more amusing hockey commentary you will ever hear. </p>

		<h2>Pär Mårts</h2>
		 
  <p>The outspoken Swedish coach had this to say on Thursday, telling Dagens Nyheter:</p>
  <blockquote class="quoted">
   <p>They play smart. The difficulty with them is not to be trapped and slow down. It’s important not to let them sap our offensive energy and allow their defense to take over - that is what they want...balance is very important and I believe that will be the key...</p>

  <p>No, they don’t. USA and Canada is the sexy matchup, there’s no doubt about that. Hockey connoisseurs know well what these teams can do, and have done in the past. </p>
  <p>Huge blow to Finland with Rask being out of the lineup however. It’s going to take something special for Suomi to overcome his loss. </p>

   <p>Make no mistake David, this is <em>the </em>biggest game here in Finland, bigger than the final, and could be considered the biggest game in the tournament. If you take World Cups and Olympics into consdieration then Canada, Finland and Sweden have been the three strongest nations in recent years. The US? Meh.......</p>

  <p>Rough translation of this tweet out of Finland:</p>
  <blockquote class="quoted">
   <p> Game costs to employers of up to 80 million according to the Economic Times. </p>

  <p>Basically, almost every person in both countries will be watching this game, never mind throughout the world. </p>

		<h2>Rask out</h2>
		 
  <p>So Rask, who willed Finland over Russia in the quarterfinal with 37 saves, is out. But what does it mean. </p>
  <p>Reader Andy Redfern says:</p>
  <blockquote class="quoted">
   <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">...</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">might not be such a blow for Suomi - the Swedes had been studying him and had claimed to have found his weakness.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
