					<p>When it was all over, after a penalty shootout incorporating three successful attempts out of 10, Gus Poyet's players were in a victory scrum in David de Gea's goalmouth and Manchester United will have to reflect that, realistically, their chances of silverware might be over. It has been a difficult, often harrowing season for David Moyes and the late drama here leaves a struggling team with only the Champions League to prevent his first year in charge becoming a total write-off.</p><p>They lost a battle of endurance and there was something about the manner of those penalties that tallied with what has happened to United since the managerial handover. Craig Gardner and Steven Fletcher missed the first two for Sunderland and De Gea also kept out Adam Johnson's effort. The problem for United was that Darren Fletcher was the only player in red to put the ball past Vito Mannone. Danny Welbeck wafted his attempt over the crossbar. Adnan Januzaj put the ball into Mannone's arms. Jones did the same as Welbeck and, finally, Mannone saved from Rafael da Silva when the Brazilian needed to score to keep United in it. Marcos Alonso and Ki Sung-yueng had beaten De Gea with Sunderland's second and third penalties and, once again, English football was left to rubberneck at what is happening inside Old Trafford.</p><p>It was an epic finale before Sunderland sealed their place at Wembley and a final against Manchester City. United had taken the match into extra-time courtesy of a first-half goal from Jonny Evans and, in an extraordinary 60 seconds, both teams scored in the final moments of the additional 30 minutes. Phil Bardsley, facing his former club, must have thought he had won it for Sunderland with a 20-yard daisy-cutter that De Gea inexplicably allowed through his grasp, Massimo Taibi-style. United, summoning all their old spirit, responded immediately through Javier Hernández. Yet Moyes admitted afterwards that his team had played with little distinction and it was revealing that senior players such as Patrice Evra and Antonio Valencia declined the chance to take a penalty. Poyet, in stark contrast, talked of his players "fighting" for the right to take one.</p><p>For Sunderland, those moments ended with delirious scenes among their 9,000-strong following. Poyet may not have the most refined side but they gave everything and had a centre-half, Wes Brown, rolling back the years. It was a victory for spirit and togetherness. There was something remarkable, nonetheless, about what happened to let them back into the game.</p><p>It was certainly a horrible mistake from De Gea to let Bardsley's shot through his grasp and over the line, almost in slow motion, to give Sunderland an aggregate lead.</p><p>Large swathes of United supporters were already heading for the exits when Januzaj crossed for Hernández to score and there was something of the old, stoic United about that piece of escapology. They actually led 1-0 in the shootout, with Fletcher putting in their second attempt. That, however, was the point when everything unravelled for the home side. They also lost Michael Carrick to an ankle injury and Moyes must wonder when a few silver linings will appear to go with the gathering clouds. <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2014/jan/22/manchester-united-juan-mata-bid-transfer" title="">Juan Mata's imminent signing</a> is a start because, Januzaj aside, it is clear why Moyes has changed his mind and decided his team need more creativity in attack.</p><p>They started the game brightly but it quickly became apparent Sunderland were going to put everything into the night. Lee Cattermole was operating as a shield in front of defence. Fabio Borini could be seen haring back from the left side of attack to help out and that attitude ran through the entire team. Mannone's heroism in the shootout was just an extension of his performance throughout the night.</p><p>United had threatened only sporadically before the stooping header from Evans made it 1-0. Fletcher had just struck the post and when Januzaj delivered a corner into the penalty area Welbeck was the first to react. His right-foot effort was miscued but the ball bounced conveniently for Evans, running in at the far post, to beat Mannone from close range.</p><p>A more confident team than Sunderland might have shown greater willingness from the start to examine whether United, after four defeats in five games, might be vulnerable, especially with Nemanja Vidic missing. Instead, it was not until the second half that, in danger of going out on the away-goal rule, they started to exert prolonged pressure on their opponents. They lacked a cutting edge but in those moments the Premier League's second-from-bottom side fully matched the champions. Poyet joked afterwards that his team needed to improve their penalty-taking. Nobody at Old Trafford will see the funny side.</p>

    	<h2>Good evening</h2>
    	
    	 <p><b>Mes que un club goes the slogan and it's mes que a two-horser in the La Liga title race this season. </b><i>They </i>are still in it, of course, as is the <i>other </i>one, but the refreshing revival of&nbsp;Atlético Madrid has provided a welcome antidote to all those (not-without-truth) accusations that Spain was just a jazzed-up version of the Scottish Premiership. All of which means, unlike previous season, Barcelona can ill-afford any slip-ups. But slip up is exactly what they did last week.&nbsp;</p><p><br><b><a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2014/jan/19/levante-barcelona-la-liga-match-report">After going behind to a Loukas Vyntra header from a set-piece after just 10 minutes</a> they thumped the life out of Levante but only found the net once, via Gerard Piqué.</b> Luckily for them,&nbsp;<a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2014/jan/19/atletico-madrid-sevilla-la-liga-match-report">Atlético choked like Jana Novotna</a> in the 1993 Wimbledon Final and could only muster a similar scoreline against Sevilla. Unluckily for them, <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2014/jan/18/real-betis-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report">Madrid played the Steffi Graf role rather well</a> and they demolished Real Betis. That's not where the bad luck ends. Yesterday, <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2014/jan/25/real-madrid-cristiano-ronaldo-granada-la-liga-match-report">Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema combined to see off Granada,</a> which means Barcelona are no longer perched on top of La Liga. Before <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/match/2014/jan/26/rayo-vallecano-v-atleticomadrid">Atlético went a few up against Rayo Vallecano this very night,</a> Madrid were top and Barcelona were the unfamiliar position of third. All of which leads us nicely on to tonight's game.&nbsp;</p><p><br><b>Hey, remember when Malaga were good and they finished top of their Champions League group (ahead of Milan!), <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2013/mar/13/malaga-porto-champions-league-match-report">knocked Porto out</a> in the next round and came this oh so agonisingly <a href="x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/items/football/2013/apr/09/borussia-dortmund-malaga-champions-league">close to doing the same to Dortmund</a> in the quarter-finals? </b>Those were the days but they are certainly not these days. This season, however, has been something of a mare. They currently reside in 16th spot in the league table, just two&nbsp; points above the danger zone and with just five points from their last six away games<b>.</b> And it is not about to &nbsp;get any easier for them. Barcelona may have slipped away from home last week but at the Camp Nou they are almost beyond imperious. All nine league games they have played at home this season they have won, scoring 31 goals in the process and letting in just six.&nbsp;</p><p><br><b>Westlife's version of the Barry Manilow classic Mandy was top of the pops when Malaga last got their leg over Barcelona</b>. Given their home form and the fact that Barça have won 29 of the 32 games against Malaga at the Camp Nou (losing their last three league trips 4-1), that doesn't look to be changing any time soon. But sure let's stick around and see what happens, eh? Team news is on its way.</p>

    	<h2>Pre-match reading</h2>
    	
    	 <p>Here is Sid Lowe on how Neymar's transfer has tarnished a club that has long prided itself on its spotless reputation in Catalonia and around the world. Enjoy.<a href="x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/lists/tag/football/barcelona"><br></a></p><blockquote class="quoted"> <p><a href="x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/lists/tag/football/barcelona">Barcelona</a> football club, the pride of Catalonia, has recently exhibited some of the finest teamplay the world's number one sport has ever seen. But its glittering global reputation is also because of how it conducts itself. <em>Més que un clube</em>, goes the phrase – "More than a club".</p><p>As befits the ideal of Catalonian independence, Barcelona shirts, for several years, did not bear the name of commercial sponsors. Instead, the club paid the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) £1.25m a year to carry the name of the charity, before switching to Qatar Foundation in 2011. Barca was good off the field as well as on it. Or that's what the world thought.</p><p>So the club's admission on Saturday that it had been, at best, disingenuous over the circumstances of the signing of Brazilian ace <a href="x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/lists/tag/football/neymar">Neymar</a> has tarnished Barcelona's image and dismayed its legions of fans. For president Sandro Rosell, the revelation has been a public humiliation.</p><p>Signing Neymar, who is almost certain to be a star of this summer's World Cup in Brazil, should have been the greatest triumph of Rosell's presidency. Instead, it has been his downfall. Rosell resigned last week, after a judge admitted a lawsuit against him following a report from the public prosecutor that asked the courts to investigate a possible case of "simulated contracts".</p><p>He departed insisting that Barcelona had done nothing illegal. But his claim that signing Neymar from Brazilian club Santos had cost "€57.1m full stop" has come under intense scrutiny. The day after his resignation, Barcelona's new president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, admitted that the total cost of securing him, which is not the same as a "transfer fee", was in fact €86.2m.</p><p>A further €44m in salary will be payable during his contract. That is surprisingly low. The investigation will now focus on the €29.1m difference and the beneficiaries of a €40m payment to Neymar's father's company, N&amp;N.</p><p>Rosell did not take questions as he presented his resignation, insisting that he was walking away in order to prevent what he called "unjustified attacks on the club" from affecting Barcelona. He insisted that the operation to sign Neymar was "correct" and implied that the unravelling of the case was due to the "jealousy" of the club's rivals. He also revealed that he had suffered threats. "I cannot put my family in danger," he said.</p><p>Bartomeu will, in principle, continue until the end of Rosell's term in 2016, although opposition groups will mobilise to push for elections earlier. Joan Laporta, the former president and Rosell's rival, is planning a return. The pair began as friends, campaigning partners and president and vice-president but fell out spectacularly and have been sworn enemies since. Charismatic and hugely successful during his previous term, Laporta remains extremely popular with supporters. In contrast, Rosell's presidency has been marked by poor communication and mistakes that have seen his popularity diminish rapidly.</p><p>Rosell had repeatedly avoided demands to clarify the exact figures beyond the €57.1m sum that the club had already made public, citing confidentiality clauses. But on Friday Bartomeu was joined by the club's director of football, Raúl Sanllehí, as they sought to explain the outlay. Bartomeu admitted that it was a "mistake" not to have explained the full figures before and that the actual transfer fee remained €57.1m.</p><p>According to those figures, Barcelona paid €17.1m to Santos and €40m to a company called N&amp;N, owned by Neymar's father, who held the player's economic rights. Bartomeu insisted that N&amp;N is separate from the player himself. Those €40m were registered in the original contracts as a "penalty" clause that referred to an agreement made well before a deal was reached with Santos.</p><p>There is a further €2m bonus payable to Santos should Neymar be a finalist in the Ballon d'Or vote. Because Santos did not own 100% of Neymar's rights, the money they received had to be divided among their Brazilian partners, which includes an investment fund.</p><p>According to Barcelona, the rest of the money is made up of a €10m signing-on bonus, a €2.7m agent's fee paid to Neymar's father, €2.5m in social work with Neymar's foundation, €7.9m on collaboration with Santos, €4m on marketing rights (€0.8m a year for the duration of his contract), and €2m to N&amp;N for scouting work to be done by Neymar's father. Neymar would also earn €8.8m a year in wages. Even if those figures are accepted, there remain serious doubts as to the true destination of the money and the reasons why the package was put together in such a complex and seemingly opaque manner.</p><p>For Barca admirers, perhaps the saving grace in the episode lies in how the scandal came to light in the first place. Barcelona prides itself on being a members club, with a elected president.</p><p>Rosell's unravelling started with a formal, legal complaint made by a member, Jordi Cases, who had questioned the real beneficiaries of the €40m paid to N&amp;N. The public prosecutor then expressed doubts about the amount received by Santos and requested that all the paperwork be handed over, with which Barcelona complied.</p><p>Rosell leaves still insisting that neither he nor the club has done anything wrong. But even if the courts do find in his favour, it will be too late to save his presidency.</p></blockquote>

    	So Atlético put four past Rayo to jump over their Madrid rivals and go top of La Liga once again.

Is it too late for Malaga to request a similar change to get something out of the game?" Not sure even that would stop Barcelona.</p>
