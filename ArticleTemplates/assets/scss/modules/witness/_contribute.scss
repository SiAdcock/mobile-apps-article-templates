<p>You could be in with the chance to win a money-can't-buy opportunity to mingle with the stars simply by uploading a picture or video of you recreating a scene from one of this year's Bafta-nominated movies. One lucky person who, in the eyes of our judges, uploads the best entry will win a pair of tickets to the Bafta awards ceremony at London's Royal Opera House on Sunday 16 February.</p>
